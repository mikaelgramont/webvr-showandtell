# TODO

- Decide on a format to represent the story.
- Pass a dummy story to the S&T object.


- look into how to render annotations. This looks promising: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_DOM_objects_into_a_canvas
See what can be done with CSS.
- possibly build a parallel between the real DOM (all hidden) and things rendered in canvas: have events in the canvas correspond to events in the DOM. That would provide a fallback for a11y users.
